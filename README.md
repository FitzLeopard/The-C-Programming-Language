### What does this repo have?

- All my code for exercises in **The C Programming Language(K & R)**. 

  Of course, some exercises do not need code so they are not included.

- All example code in **The C Programming Language(K & R)**.

  I will try to include all of them

- Some standard solutions for the exercises

  Those standard solutions are from the corresponding solution manual **The C Answer Book**.

  Those standard solutions are chosen for some reasons in the list:

  - They are compact and elegant
  - They are correct and my first-version answer is wrong
  - I am unable to tell whether my answer is right or not(This is normal because this book does not provide a standard online judge)

- Notes on part of the exercises

- Notes on part of the examples

### Scheduled To-Do List

##### What is this list for?

There are some exercises that are so interesting that I desire to solve them on my own but they are also so difficult or complex that I don't have time right now(I am a professional student). To remind me of them and urge me to solve them, I create this list. Every item will contain:

- The exercise ID
- The scheduled day to solve it
- Whether it is solved or not

#### List

| Exercise ID | Scheduled Day to solve it | Status   |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | -------- |
| 1-24        | 2018-06-26                | Unsolved |
| 5-5         | 2018-07-01                | Unsolved |
| 5-6         | 2018-07-01                | Unsolved |
| 5-12        | 2018-07-03                | Unsolved |



### Scheduled Rewritten List

##### What is this list for?

There are some exercises that I get it wrong in the first time and I need to rewrite them to strengthen my understanding of them. 

And there are also some difficult but interesting exercise that I really want to master the solution to them( particularly those listed in **Scheduled To-Do List** ). So I may need to solve it on my own and then compare my solution to the standard one and revisit them some time later.

#### List

| Exercise ID | Scheduled Day to rewrite it | Status |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | ------ |
| 1-23        | 2018-06-26                  | To-Do  |
| 2-1         | 2018-06-28                  | To-Do  |
| 2-2         | 2018-06-28                  | To-Do  |
| 2-8         | 2018-06-28                  | To-Do  |
